# hello-world
My first Hello World program project since C++ class in 10th grade 1996.  Shout out to Mr. Latimer!
I have always been facinated by editing and creating code ever since I got games on the TI-83, but I never committed to learning and making it my career path.  Now, the time has come to stop making excuses and learn in order to build my confidence and worth.
